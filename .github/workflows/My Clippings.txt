I’ve never really been jealous of anything, except maybe people with fast cars. But every day I find myself jealous of the things that make up your day. I’m jealous of the coffee you drink, because it has the taste of your lips. I’m jealous of your pillow at night, because it holds all your secrets. I’m jealous of all your blankets, because they’re tangled up in you. I’m jealous of the stars outside your window, because they get to watch you sleep. I’m jealous of all your distractions, because they have your time over me. I’m jealous of the things that keep you awake, because lately I don’t think they’re me. But more than anything, I’m jealous of your 6 a.m., because it’ll never tell you how perfect you look, when you just wake up.

When I think about time, I think of how quickly it passes. I think of all the things we could have done with our time and all the days and weeks I was yours and you were mine. The first time I met you, we were only neighbors, and I know my memory is a little faded, but from that moment my love for you has never wavered. Time has moved on since that memory, and we have all these new ones to share. Some of them are beautiful, some are ugly, some don’t even seem fair. I think about all our trials, our road trips, festivals, and the nights spent talking about our future. Somewhere along the way we lost ourselves and lost each other. To be without you is an ache, a feeling of seeing you in all things and every color. I know we have our own journeys, our demons to fight, but I wanted you to know I think of you and us almost every night. Even if we are apart, I grow for you and I know that you grow for me too. Because in the end I know that you are the most beautiful girl I have ever seen, and all I want for us is to be together again.

There is great freedom in only having yourself. Not having to worry about supporting anyone else, not having to think or make choices with anyone else in mind. But there is still an ache, some days duller than others, some days not felt until the early hours. It will grasp at you when you think about an achievement and receiving an award and you want someone to be in the corner beaming with pride. You think about it over coffee, when no one is looking at you instead of drinking theirs. In the middle of the night when it’s cold and no one is there breathing gently beside you. When you come home and the house is empty, and even if it’s peaceful and quiet, you would like to share your thoughts with someone as they set dinner on the table. The freedom to belong to yourself is beautiful, but it’s also beautiful to look at someone else and know their favorite moment of the day is when you walk into the room.

Don’t waste your time with people who bring you down. Bitterness is a disease that gets the better of most people, but that doesn’t mean you need to tolerate it. You have flaws just like anybody else. Embrace them, live for them. There is only one you. Forgiveness is happiness. They walk hand in hand. You don’t have to forgive everyone in your life. But you do have to forgive yourself. Every time.

Happiness is coming home to a freshly made bed. To a house full of scented candles, a glass of wine after the daily struggle. It’s walking in the door and hearing the words, “I love you.” It’s sitting opposite her in your favorite restaurant and hearing, “I’ll support you in everything you do.”

To be happy isn’t always to be with others. Some of life’s greatest thinking is done while we are alone. Other people can’t learn to breathe again for you. Other people can’t feel or see or hear things in the way you do. Sometimes being happy is stepping away from the things you know. It’s breathing in and out and watching your soul grow.

Your self-talk determines your self-worth. We are all the stories we tell ourselves. I’m a loser! I can never wake up early! I can never get along with people!! OR If I take small steps, I can do it! I am enough! I have handled more difficult things in the past! Every morning we wake up. To live a life that runs through our stories. While looking at ourselves in the mirror. We can change the story we tell ourselves.

Goodbye is hard sometimes because the action of leaving is so permanent, and yet that person still occupies so much of the space within your chest. Goodbye isn’t final, it isn’t a finish line you have to step over in order to forget. See, you can’t unlove someone. You can’t get their scent out of your pillowcases, can’t unlearn their name and forget what it felt like to be immersed in the hope and beauty of another human being. People never stay gone. They show up in street corners, they show up in familiar laughs and the booth at that one restaurant where you first held their hand. Goodbye isn’t as simple as many make it seem; goodbye isn’t really goodbye, not for someone who still cares. Not for the person left in the aftermath of a hurricane they once loved.

There is still time for you. I don’t care what you have been through; I don’t care about the wounds or the pain or the scars or the hurt. None of that makes what you are a waste, none of that discounts the fact that you have purpose, that you mean something. Please, don’t ever forget—even when you ache all over, even when the world is not kind—you are needed here. You are needed.
